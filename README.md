Mobile application developed based on the application of Getting MEAN 2nd Edition book. The book takes in only a API and a web client, I developed the mobile app myself with React Native.
The app is fully integrated with native geolocation service and with the API developed on the book, which is hosted on Heroku (mine is on [mysterious-depths-49888.heerokuapp.com](https://mysterious-depths-49888.heerokuapp.com)).

The book covers all process of developing/deploying a API and a frontend client with MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js (MEAN Stack). Totally recommended for beginners.

Feel free to fork/clone or open issues here, I'll be happy to help :)
